# AirlineTycoon

This repository aims to complete the partial source code that is provided as a free bonus in the GOG release
of Airline Tycoon Deluxe. To run it you'll need the game assets from the either the First Class, Evolution or
Deluxe edition of the game. You can purchase these assets from GOG.com: https://www.gog.com/game/airline_tycoon_deluxe

## What works?

The singleplayer game is fully playable without issues. Network multiplayer support has been reimplemented using
ENet and alternatively using RakNet instead of DirectPlay and might behave differently than the original.

The game can also be played on Linux.

```
git submodule update --init
```

More build instructions will follow soon.
